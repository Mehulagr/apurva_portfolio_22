        <h3>CloudWatch Evidently</h3>
        <p>Experimentation [A/B testing] and launch monitoring for application developers and product owners.</p>
        <p>Evidently is a new AWS service/ product under Cloudwatch’s application monitoring suite of services which allows application developers and product owners able to A/B test new features, experiences and APIs and incrementally launch them with confidence. The fairly complex services combines the power of feature flags with advanced statistical analysis to provide accurate insights into the perfromance of a certain version and reduce launch risks by modifying traffic based on response to the business and perfromance KPI’s.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <p>Amazon has a rich culture of experimentation that goes back 15 years. Teams across retail, entertainment, devices etc. use internal tools to A/B test features before they are launched. Unfortunately, the internal tool did not serve the needs of AWS services.</p>
            <p>Initial goal was to build a managed service that allows AWS services to test and launch their features, with a vision to develop a managed service that customers of AWS can also leverage.</p>
            <p>Evidently as a service launched as a Tier 1 service for both internal teams and external customers at Re:Invent 2021 - becoming Top 5 Re:Invent launches.</p>
